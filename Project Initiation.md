# Project Initiation

## PM's Responsibilities

### Identify the project's goals

### Identify the project's resources

### Identify the project's success criteria agreed

## Benefits

### Save time & extra work throughout the project

### Ensure the benefits of project outcome will outweigh the costs (minimize risks & maximize gains)

## Cost Benefit Analysis

### Steps

- Determine the costs

	- How much time will be spend on the project?
	- What are the one-time costs?
	- Are there any ongoing costs?
	- Intangible cost

		- might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

- Determine the benefits

	- What are the values of the project?
	- How much money could be saved by the project outcomes?
	- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
	- How much time will be saved?
	- How will the UX be improved?
	- Intangible benefits

		- Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 
		- Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 
		- Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?
		- Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

### Benefits

- Minimize risks
- Maximize gains
- Reduce biases
- Keep stakeholder's self-interest from influencing decisions

## Key Components

### Goals

- Measurements

	- SMART

		- Specific

			- The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret.

				- What to accomplish?
				- Why is this a goal?
				- Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit?
				- Who is involved, and who is the recipient: employees, customers, the community at large?
				- Where should the goal be delivered?
				- What are the requirements and constraints?

		- Measurable

			- Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.

				- How much?
				- How many?
				- How will I know when it's accomplished?

		- Attainable

			- The project team agrees the objective is realistic.

				- Should be able to be reasonably reached
				- Encourage growth
				- Not too extreme
				- Clues

					- How can it be accomplished?
					- Breakdown goals into smaller parts & check if it makes sense

		- Relevant

			- The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.

				- Does the goal makes sense?
				- Is the goal worthwhile?
				- Is it the right time?

		- Time Bound

			- The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

				- Has a deadline

	- OKR 
(Objectives & Key Results)

		- Set the objectives

			- Criteria

				- Aspirational
				- Align with organizational goals
				- Action oriented
				- Concrete
				- Significant

			- Clue

				- Does the objective help in achieving the project’s overall goals?
				- Does the objective align with company and departmental OKRs?
				- Is the objective inspiring and motivational?
				- Will achieving the objective make a significant impact?

			- Examples

				- Increase market reach
				- Build the most secure data security software 
				- Provide a top-performing service
				- Achieve top sales among competitors in the region
				- Continuously improve web analytics and conversions
				- Make a universally-available app

		- Develop key results

			- Key results should be time-bound
			- Criteria

				- Results-oriented—not a task
				- Measurable and verifiable
				- Specific and time-bound
				- Aggressive yet realistic

			- Clue

				- What does success mean?
				- What metrics would prove that we’ve successfully achieved the objective?

			- Examples

				- X% new signups within first quarter post launch
				- Increase advertiser spend by X%
				- New feature adoption is at least X%
				- Maximum 2 critical bugs are reported by customers per Sprint
				- Maintain newsletter unsubscribe rate at X%

		- Best Practices

			- The objective describes what you want to do
			- The key results describe how you’ll know you did it
			- Add 2–3 key results for each objective
			- Document your OKRs and link to them in your project plan

- Example: To increase revenue by 5% through a new service called Plant Pals that offers desk plants to top customers by the end of the year

				- Tools

					- Power Grid

						- 2 x 2 grid
						- Keys

							- Interest
							- Influence

						- Values

							- High
							- Low

						- Management

							- Low interest X low influence

								- Monitor
								- Minimum effort

							- Low interest X high influence

								- Consult them & meet their needs
								- High priority

							- High interest X low influence

								- Show considerations

							- High interest X high influence

								- Close partner to reach the desired outcomes
								- High effort

					- RACI Chart
(Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM))

						- Participation

							- Responsible

								- Those doing the work to complete the task

							- Accountable

								- Those making sure the work gets done
								- Only 1 maximum accountable role for each task or deliverable

							- Consulted

								- Those giving feedback, like subject matter experts or decision-makers

							- Informed

								- Those just needing to know the final decisions or that a task is complete

						- Steps

							- List all tasks or deliverables (not too specific)
							- Assign appropriate role for each stakeholder
							- Assign R-A-C-I letters to each role for each task or deliverable

						- Function

							- Workload balance

								- Identify potentially overloaded member indicated by "R" assigned
								- If you find that you don’t have the right people to assign responsibilities to, take a step back and evaluate your team

						- Put RACI into practice

							- Share RACI chart with sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and sign-off
							- Set clear expectations for the team and ensure that everyone is aligned on their responsibilities
							- Document the team and stakeholders’ acknowledgment of these expectations through the project charter, meeting notes, and in the RACI chart itself

						- Tips

							- Write role rather than member's name
							- Used for larger complex project

			- Buy-in

				- Process of involving these people in decision-making to hopefully reach a broader consensus on the organization's future

					- Pay particular attention to your high-impact stakeholders and make sure they feel looped in
					- Explain to them how the project will help them achieve their goals, and you want to have their support later on if any issues come up

				- Tips

					- Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder
					- Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team
					- Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate

- What is the budget? 
- Who are the stakeholders? 

### Unrealistic expectations

- Understand the requirements of a project before agreeing to any deadlines
- Don't commit to firm dates when initiating the project to avoid setting unrealistic expectations
- You will have more information and will be able to better manage expectations in the planning phase

### Miscommunication

- Information is not communicated in a timely manner
- Information does not include pertinent information (risks, decisions made, scope changes, etc.)
- Information is not sent to the correct stakeholders
- Solution

	- Set expectations for your communication approach early

### Lack of resources

- Confirm their availability with leadership up front to avoid delays or issues further along in the project

### Scope creep

- Make sure that everything is documented in the initiation phase
- Have a plan for how to handle scope creep if it occurs
- Clarify who has the authority to approve scope changes

## Review with key stakeholders & approval
